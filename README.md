# World Population (Capstone 3 at Microverse)

## Introduction

### About the requirements

> This is the repo for the third capstone project in my Microverse journey. It's a React app about world population. A video of me presenting the project is available [here](https://www.loom.com/share/).

I had to put together all the knowledge I gained from the React/Redux module at Microverse in order to build this project in 5 working days. The project had to be API-based and the requirements included: 

- Build the project as a single page application (SPA) built with React and Redux.
- Retrieve the data from an API should be stored in the Redux store.
- Use a Filter stateless component to filter the data retrieved from the API.
- Use React Router so that every page should be accessible from a unique route.
- Deploy the project to make it accessible online;

> For the UI, I was expected to take inspiration from [this design from Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31579789/Ballhead-App-(Free-PSDs)).


### More about the project

I chose to build this project around [a countries API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1134062/T1LJjU52#intro).
It's a single page app called **WorldPopulation** as it allows users to see metrics about the world population and play around it.

As a user:

- I can see on the home page the list of countries/regions and their population.
- When I click a country card, I'm taken to a page with the country's population details.
- On the details page I can see details about the population of the selected country, city by city.
